    Taken example:
    
    - FSRCNN (as one of the fastest algorithms)

2. Region tracking (only OpenCV)

    Task:           to track specific region (pre-aimed to the screens center)

    Taken example:
    
    - MIL
    
    - KCF
    
    - CSRT

3. Basic geometrical shapes recognition (only OpenCV)

    Task: to recognise geometrical shapes and underline its type
